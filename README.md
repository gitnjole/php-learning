#  PHP Learning

This is a collection of scripts I wrote to study for exams during my PHP education. I've used Obsidian to write and study from these scripts and would like to encourage you to read the following files through Obsidian or any other note reading application capable of viewing markdown content.

The scripts cover a large range of topics such as:
- LAMP
- Linux commands/permissions
- Basic PHP
- Object-oriented PHP including object-oriented design patterns
- a QnA section featuring both approved ALGEBRA questions and AI generated questions
- a solutions page for programming solutions

Most of the script is written in Croatian, however it is easily translatable to English or any other language. This script isn't novice friendly and assumes you understand basic concepts of programming. Personally I use these scripts as a gentle reminder while studying using other resources so I wouldn't recommend using only this repository to learn PHP or programming in general.
